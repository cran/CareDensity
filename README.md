# CareDensity

Author: Robin Denz

## Description

`CareDensity` is a small R-Package which can be used to calculate the care density index and the fragmented care density.

## Installation

A developmental version of this package may be installed from github using the `remotes` R-Package:

```R
library(remotes)

remotes::install_github("RobinDenz1/CareDensity")
```

## Bug Reports and Feature Requests

If you encounter any bugs or have any specific feature requests, please file an [Issue](https://github.com/RobinDenz1/CareDensity/issues).

## Examples

Suppose you have the following patient-provider data:

```R
data <- data.frame(PatID=c("1", "1", "1", "2", "2", "3", "3", "4", "5"),
                   ArztID=c("A", "C", "D", "A", "D", "A", "D", "D", "C"))
```

This is essentially a description of the following bipartite network:

The simple care density can then be calculated like this:

```R
care_density(data)
```
